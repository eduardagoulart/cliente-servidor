<h1>Home Is Where The Heart Is </h1>
<h3>Lynyrd Skynyrd</h3>

<p>I've always lived my life like a gypsy <br>
I can't imagine myself settlin' down <br>
So please don't ask me to give up this life I lead <br>
'Cause I love to feel those wheels go 'round and 'round <br>
<br>
(chorus) <br> 
I can see it inside <br>
It's my heart that sees, not my eyes <br>
And if you listen close I'll tell you why <br>
Home is where the heart is <br>
And my heart is at home with you <br>
There's a cold wind blowin' and you know it's almost midnight <br>
You never dreamed it would be this hard lovin' a music man <br>
<br>
 

But this iron horse on which I ride I'm closer it's true <br>
And it's just as hard for me as it is for you <br>
I can see it inside <br>
It's my heart that sees not my eyes <br>
And if you listen close I'll tell you why <br>
Home is where the heart is <br>
And my heart is at home with you <br>
In my life I'm always on the run <br>
Livin' one day at a time <br>
Hold on a little longer <br>
I don't know where I'm gonna end up <br>
Or where I'll go <br>
I can see it inside <br>
It's my heart that sees not my eyes <br>
And if you listen close I'll tell you why <br>
Home is where the heart is <br>
And my heart is at home ... <br>
I can see it inside <br>
It's my heart that sees not my eyes <br> 
And if you listen close I'll tell you why <br>
Home is where the heart is <br>
And my heart is at home with you <br>
Home is where the heart is <br>
Oh ,my home is where my heart is <br>
Oh, my home is where my heart is <br>
